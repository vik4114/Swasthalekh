The health tracker has many benefits for both patients and healthcare providers. It removes the need for patients to store and hold paper notes every time they visit a doctor. They will basically take their entire medical history with them everywhere they go with the digital medical record.

Digital medical record can be helpful in more than one way in terms of patient safety and better treatment. It avoids prescription and report legibility problems, offers 24/7 access to healthcare information, decreases duplication, saves time, and assists healthcare providers in making better decisions by understanding patient allergies, current medications, and correct dosages, previous diagnoses and treatment plans.

Once adopted, this will serve as a seamless communication platform whenever a patient migrates from one physician to another, as the comprehensive information allows the physician with a better understanding of patientâ€™s history.  It can also play a pivotal role in documenting vital signs and symptoms, and the retention of information over periods of time can help a physician make competent informed treatment decisions.

This project is a tiny, yet concrete step towards total digitization and unifying the entire medical and healthcare system of a large population. A tremendous amount of needless inconvenience and suffering can be eliminated by ensuring that health records are universally available. India too, needs a individualized digital record that is comprehensive, user friendly, easy to learn and use to make patient healthcare safe and secure. Standardizing such a healthcare system with comprehensive documentation of patients will go a long way in moving hand in hand with the established health scenario, and saving lives.
